# 🧘‍♀️ Yoga with Jib — Class Tracker

A clean, minimal class tracking app for yoga teachers. Students buy prepaid packages (20, 30, or 40 classes) and you deduct one each time they attend. Students can see their own balance on the same page.

## Adding Fabfeltscript Bold (optional)

1. Download **Fabfeltscript Bold** from [cdnfonts.com](https://www.cdnfonts.com) or [dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com)
2. Upload the font file (e.g. `FabfeltScript-Bold.woff2`) to your GitHub repo alongside `index.html`
3. In `index.html`, replace the Google Fonts `<link>` tag with:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'FabfeltScript';
  src: url('FabfeltScript-Bold.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('FabfeltScript-Bold.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

4. Find `.brand-main` in the CSS and add:

```css
.brand-main {
  font-family: 'FabfeltScript', cursive;
}
```

## Customisation

| What | Where in index.html |
|------|-------------------|
| Brand name | Find `Yoga with Jib` in the HTML (appears twice) |
| Pink color | Find and replace `#fb2a7b` |
| Package sizes | Edit the `.pkg-opt` buttons in the modals |
| Card colors | Edit the `COLORS` array in the script |
| Symbol options | Edit the `SYMBOLS` array in the script |
| Default PIN | Change `'1234'` in `let pin = '1234'` |

## Tech

- Plain HTML + CSS + JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools
- IBM Plex Sans via Google Fonts
- Data saved in `localStorage` (stays on the device/browser)

> **Note:** Because data is stored in `localStorage`, each device/browser has its own copy. If you want all devices to share the same data, you would need a backend database.
